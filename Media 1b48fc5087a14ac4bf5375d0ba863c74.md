Naked data science is one of the leading data science podcasts on spotify. The episode discusses the common misconception that data science always involves machine learning and clarifies that many data-intensive problems do not require ML techniques, even in major tech firms like FAANG. Nima, a former Machine Learning researcher, shares his transition to becoming a problem-solver using data science, offering tips for others to make a similar shift. This podcast is very interesting as it addresses a very common missconception. 

### Learning Apps and websites

Kubicle is a digital learning platform build around data education. It was instrumental in my journey of learning data analytics. Besides Python courses it offers also other programming languages and excel courses.

[Data Analysis Courses | Online Courses for All Levels](https://www.datacamp.com/category/data-analysis)

Data Camp is a similar resource as kubicle but with significantly more content and a wider range of tools. This is especially useful for more advanced learners who want to get exposed to additional tools and more advanced problems. This tool is also very well recognized in a variety of industries making it particularly useful to showcase ones skills.

Mimo is a great tool for beginners that want to get into coding. It works with a high degree for gamification and is perfect for self study. However, I would not recommend it for people who already have some degree of coding knowledge, as it does not go in depth as far as Data Camp or Kubicle.
